# Typescript-Jasmine-expect-sample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

* Then I follow the manual from  [Jasmine-expect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine-expect)
* One last tip cames from an [Issue](https://github.com/JamieMason/Jasmine-Matchers/issues/100)

Now it works as expected.
